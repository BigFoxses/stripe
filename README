stripe v0.2 Alpha
Written by Foeh Mannay, December 2014

PURPOSE
=======

"stripe" is a tool which attempts to remove any and all encapsulating headers (i.e.
VLAN tags, MPLS shim headers, PPPoE, GRE, L2TP and GTP) from a pcap file, leaving plain
old payload over Ethernet. This is useful as some tools cannot work with encapsulated
frames and, until now, I couldn't find any automatic way to convert a pcap with such
headers into a usable format.

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on the
theory behind this if you are interested.

INSTALLATION
============

For Linux / Mac / MinGW it should be possible to build from source using:

gcc -o stripe stripe.c

I will make some binaries available for convenience but I make no assurances that I will
keep them up to date.

USAGE
=====

There are only two parameters and both are mandatory. You must specify your
input capture file (original pcap format) with the -r flag and your output capture file
with the -w flag. Here's an example:

Harrys-MacBook-Air:stripe foeh$ ./stripe -r mpls-frames.cap -w clean-frames.cap

Parsing capfile...

4 frames processed.
Harrys-MacBook-Air:stripe foeh$

CHANGE LOG
==========

v0.1a	First working release, tested with 802.1Q VLANs, MPLS, GRE and PPPoE. L2TP in 
development.

v0.2a	Added "experimental" GTP support, realised the need to pad small frames!
